General, simple and easy to use structured validation library that gives you
control over the error and input types.

New version was reworked, and now it has no dependencies (other than `base`).
Other than a new `Monad` instance, the documentation is a lot more sparse now.
Sometimes, too much "blah blah" only obscures the relevant info.
